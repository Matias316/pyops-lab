# pyops-lab
A curated set of Python exercises inspired by real-world SRE tasks.

These exercises simulate common SRE scenarios like:
- Parsing logs and alerts
- Validating metrics thresholds
- Automating incident recovery logic
- Simulating system behavior (latency, retries, usage)
- Working with Kubernetes or PostgreSQL data
